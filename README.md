My application will mainly be showing the Chinese food menu in Dragon King takeaway restaurant in North Sydney.
 
Application will mainly provide the information of the type of foods which they service, price and few descriptions of food nutrition. When a customer comes to the restaurant, he/she can be able to look through the menu, loop through the food and drink and pick up what he/she likes to order. The app can be able to add the total price after the order has been made and lead them through the payment system. Or if the customer changes their mind which he/she doesn't want the food anymore, the app can be able to go back to the main menu anytime the customer leaves the screen or cancel the order.

In the city where all the businesses are located , the demand with the pressure of work can kill all the free time which people have between lunch or dinner.
